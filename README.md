# Pizza-Sales-SQL-Portfolio-Project

📌 Project Overview

This project is built around a pizza sales dataset to explore different SQL concepts and business-related insights. The idea was to practice SQL queries that mimic real-world business questions such as tracking revenue, identifying best-selling products, and analyzing customer ordering patterns.

It helped me strengthen my SQL skills while also learning how data can drive decisions in the food & beverage industry.

🗂️ Dataset Structure

The database is structured into the following main tables:

Orders – Stores details about each order (Order ID, Date, Time).

Order_Details – Links each order with pizzas ordered and their quantities.

Pizzas – Contains pizza IDs, sizes, and prices.

Pizza_Types – Provides pizza names, categories, and descriptions.

🧑‍💻 SQL Queries Covered

I wrote queries to answer different business questions, such as:

1. Total number of orders placed

2. Total revenue generated

3. Highest-priced pizza

4. Most common pizza size ordered

5. Top 5 most ordered pizza types

6. Category-wise total quantity ordered

7. Distribution of orders by hour of the day

8. Category-wise pizza distribution

9. Average number of pizzas ordered per day

10. Top 3 pizzas by revenue

11. Percentage revenue contribution by category

12. Cumulative revenue over time

13. Top 3 pizzas by revenue within each category

Each query is written step by step with comments for clarity.

🔑 Key Insights

The project highlights which pizzas drive the most revenue and what sizes customers prefer most.

It shows how SQL can be used not just for raw data handling, but also for generating business insights.

Querying time-based sales data (by date/hour) can be very useful for staffing and inventory management decisions.
